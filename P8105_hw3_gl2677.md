observations. There are 1,384,617 observations of 131,209 unique users
and 15 vaiables in the `instacart` dataset, where each row is a product
from an order. The key variables are

``` r
aisle = instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) 
aisle %>% 
  filter(min_rank(desc(n)) == 1)
```
