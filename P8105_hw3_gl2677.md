## Problem 1

There are 1,384,617 observations of 131,209 unique users and 15
variables in the `instacart` dataset, where each row is a product from
an order. The key variables are the ID and name of the product, aisle,
department, together with the hour of the day and the day of the week on
which the order was placed.

Here is an illustrative example of observations. The first 8 rows are
from the same order with ID number `1` for the user with ID number
`112108`. This is the `4`th order this user has placed, and it has been
`9` days since the last order. In this order, there are totally 8
products. The `1`st product added to cart was `Bulgarian Yogurt` with ID
number `49302` from `yogurt` aisle with ID number`120`, `dairy eggs`
department with ID number `16`. This product has been ordered by this
user in the past and it was placed at `10` o’clock, `Thursday` this
time.

``` r
data("instacart")
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

  - There are totally 134 aisles in the dataset. `fresh vegetables` are
    the most items ordered from, and the majority of items are ordered
    from `fresh vegetables` and `fresh fruits`.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = forcats::fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n, fill = aisle)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "The number of items ordered in each aisle",
       x = "Aisle",
       y = "The number of items") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

<img src="P8105_hw3_gl2677_files/figure-gfm/plot-1.png" width="90%" />

  - There are 39 aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. The plot
    shows most of items ordered in `fresh vegetables`, `fresh fruits`,
    and `packaged vegetables fruits`, and totally around 375,000 items
    are oredered in these three aisles. People mainly use The Instacart
    Online Grocery Shopping to buy vegetables and fruits in 2017.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients","dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  filter(min_rank(desc(n)) <= 3) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "The number of times each item is ordered against the three most popular items in each aisle.")
```

| product\_name                                 | aisle                      |    n |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- | ---: |
| Organic Baby Spinach                          | packaged vegetables fruits | 9784 |
| Organic Raspberries                           | packaged vegetables fruits | 5546 |
| Organic Blueberries                           | packaged vegetables fruits | 4966 |
| Light Brown Sugar                             | baking ingredients         |  499 |
| Pure Baking Soda                              | baking ingredients         |  387 |
| Cane Sugar                                    | baking ingredients         |  336 |
| Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats | dog food care              |   30 |
| Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           | dog food care              |   28 |
| Small Dog Biscuits                            | dog food care              |   26 |

The number of times each item is ordered against the three most popular
items in each aisle.

  - `packaged vegetables fruits` is the most frequently ordered aisles,
    and `dog food care` is the least frequently ordered one.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples","Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_h = round(mean(order_hour_of_day))) %>% 
  mutate(order_dow = recode(order_dow, `0` = "Sunday",
                            `1` = "Monday",
                            `2` = "Tuesday",
                            `3` = "Wednesday",
                            `4` = "Thursday",

  pivot_wider(names_from = order_dow,
              values_from = mean_h) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "The mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered") 
```

| product\_name    | Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday |
| :--------------- | :----- | :----- | :------ | :-------- | :------- | :----- | :------- |
| Coffee Ice Cream | 14:00  | 14:00  | 15:00   | 15:00     | 15:00    | 12:00  | 14:00    |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13:00  | 11:00  | 12:00   | 14:00     | 12:00    | 13:00  | 12:00    |

The mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream
are ordered

  - Most of `Coffee Ice Cream` is ordered between two o’clock and three
    o’clock in the afternoon during the week. `Pink Lady Apples` is
    ordered with unfixed time, which is between eleven o’clock in the
    morning and two o’clock in the afternoon.

## Problem 2

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
overall_health = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  mutate(response = forcats::fct_relevel(response, c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")),
         state = locationabbr,
         county = locationdesc) 
```

``` r
states_2002 = overall_health %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  distinct(county) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(n >= 7) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) 

states_2010 = overall_health %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  distinct(county) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(n >= 7) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) 
```

  - In 2002, totally `6` states (\[most locations first\]`PA, MA, NJ,
    CT, FL, NC`) were observed at 7 or more locations. The range of the
    number of locations in the state is from 10 to 7.
  - In 2010, totally `14` states (\[most locations first\]`FL, NJ, TX,
    CA, MD, NC, NE, WA, MA, NY, OH, CO, PA, SC`) were observed at 7 or
    more locations. The range of the number of locations in the state is
    from 41 to 7.
  - The number of locations in the state increases in 2010 compared to
    2002.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
overall_health %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
  group_by(state,year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_data_value = mean(data_value)) %>% 
  arrange(mean_data_value) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_data_value, color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Average data value over time within a state",
       subtitle = "limited to Excellent responses",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Mean data-value(%)")
```

<img src="P8105_hw3_gl2677_files/figure-gfm/excellent-1.png" width="90%" />

  - Most of states share the similar pattern of mean `data_value`, and
    it fluctuates between 15% and 30%. However, mean`data_value` of
    state `WV` in 2005 and 2009, and state `IN` in 2007 is obviously
    lower than 15%.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
data_value_2006 = overall_health %>%
  filter(year == 2006) %>% 
  filter(state == "NY") %>% 
  group_by(response) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = data_value, 
             fill = response, group = response)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,hjust = 1),
        legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of data-value for responses among locations in NY state in 2006",
       x = "",
       y = "Data-value(%)")

data_value_2010 = overall_health %>%
  filter(year == 2010) %>% 
  filter(state == "NY") %>% 
  group_by(response) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = data_value, 
             fill = response, group = response)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of data-value for responses among locations in NY state in 2010",
       x = "",
       y = "Data-value(%)")
data_value_2006 / data_value_2010
```

<img src="P8105_hw3_gl2677_files/figure-gfm/two-panel-1.png" width="90%" />

  - For 2006 and 2010, the peaks of `data_value`increase in the order of
    `Poor`,`Fair`, `Excellent`, `Good` and `Very good`.
  - The peaks of `data_value` decrease for `Poor` and `Fair` in 2010
    compared to those in 2006, and the peaks of `data_value` increase
    for `Excellent`, `Good` and `Very good` in 2010 compared to those in
    2006.

## Problem 3

``` r
activity = read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(activity_1:activity_1440, 
               names_to = "minute",
               names_prefix = "activity_",
               values_to = "minute_activity") %>% 
  mutate(minute = as.numeric(minute),
         week = as.factor(week),
         weekday = factor(day %in% c("Sunday", "Saturday"), 
                          levels = c(TRUE, FALSE), 
                          labels = c("weekend", "weekday")),
         day = forcats::fct_relevel(day, c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")))   
```

  - There are 50400 observations and 6 variables in `acticity` dataset.
    The variables are `week, day_id, day, minute, minute_activity,
    weekday`. `week`, `day` and `weekday` are factor variables, the
    others are numeric variables. For each observation, the dataset
    shows the activity counts for the exact minute of a 24-hour day
    starting at midnight on exact day and exact week.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
activity %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarize(day_activity = sum(minute_activity)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = day,
              values_from = day_activity) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 0,
               caption ="The total activity over the day for five weeks") 
```

| week | Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday |
| :--- | -----: | -----: | ------: | --------: | -------: | -----: | -------: |

The total activity over the day for five weeks

``` r
 activity %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarize(day_activity = sum(minute_activity)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = day_activity, color = week, group = week)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "The total activity over the day for five weeks",
       x = "",
       y = "Day activity counts")
```

<img src="P8105_hw3_gl2677_files/figure-gfm/day_activity table-1.png" width="90%" />

  - The accelerometer acticity counts for all five weeks increase on
    Wednesday compared to Tuesday. and they all are numerically similar
    between Tuesday and Thursay. The activity counts on Saturday drop to
    the same value (1440) in week 4 and week 5.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
activity %>% 
  mutate(hour = minute %/% 60) %>% 
  group_by(hour, day) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour_activity = mean(minute_activity)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = mean_hour_activity,
             color = day, group = day)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = " 24-hour activity time courses for each day ",
       x = "Hour in the day",
       y = "Mean hour activity counts")
```

<img src="P8105_hw3_gl2677_files/figure-gfm/minute_activity plot-1.png" width="90%" />

  - The `mean_hour_activity` except on Sunday has the similar pattern
    that the counts increase starting from around 5:00 and reach a peak
    around 20:00, then decrease until 23:00. This means the most intense
    physical activity occurs around eight o’clock in the evening, and he
    might get up around five o’clock in the morning and go to bed around
    eleven o’clock in the evening.
  - The `mean_hour_activity` counts on Sunday increase starting from
    around 5:00 and reach a peak around 11:00, then decrease until
    23:00. This means the most intense physical activity occurs around
    11 o’clock in the morning, and he might get up around five o’clock
    in the morning and go to bed around eleven o’clock in the evening.
